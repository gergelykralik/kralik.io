Found tremendous number of excuses why I didn't want to start learning something new, like a framework. My arguments were, I don't need this (false), I have no time for this (false), I'm too tired (true, but whatever).

Recently overcame my lazyness and started learning [Laravel](https://laravel.com/). After the initial confusion I was like, "Holy s*@# this is something.". Started to experiment, 2 days later I had an app ready, (currently in production with little modifications).

As all the new things Laravel too has a bit steep learning curve, but it's not too much if you're willing to learn, with some curiosity.
What is it all about?

*	- OOP and nothing else

*	- [ACID, DRY, etc.](http://www.laravelbestpractices.com/)

*	- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

*	- [webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack) (Mix), [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

*	- Excellent [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4)

*	- Useful video-learning, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com/)

After you successfully wrap our head around the structure of the framework, it's really great, and well-built. Of course if you didn't used Composer, or asset buildig (webpack) you will need to look into it, but after, the world is yours.

**Go build something awesome!**
